Step 4: Committing Changes
--------------------------
- Will stage this new file using git add
- Will create a commit with a descriptive message
- The commit message will describe what was added

Step 5: Pushing to Remote
-------------------------
- Will push the changes to the remote branch
- Using: git push -u origin claude/create-a-detailed-file-fR2uQ
- This ensures the changes are available on the remote repository
